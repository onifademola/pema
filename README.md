This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The feature would have both overtime and off Duty management.

Overtime is calculated in hours and is for junior staffs, while Off Duty calculated in days is for senior staffs and above.

Overtime users are Operators, Artisans and Process Artisans.

Off-Duty users are Process Artisans and above.

This would also include Free Issue management where; everyone can change their free issue; Junior staffs are 5 cases while senior are 6 cases.

I also have their data attached. 

Then the complaint section where people can raise a complaint, make a request or inquire about something.

The last feature is the Sick leave management.
People can send in their excuse without coming to work. Stating the details of their illness.


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
